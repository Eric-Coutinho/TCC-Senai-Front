# TCC Senai

This is the last Senai Project for the System Developer Course, which my project partner Lander and I are currently taking. This specific repository is the FrontEnd part of the project, the BackEnd part is available at the repository: [BackEnd](https://github.com/Eric-Coutinho/TCC-Senai-Back)

## Idea

This project is based on the BPS-Cross Product being developed by the BPS team (Bosch Product Solutions) at Bosch Curitiba.
The main goal of this system is to be able to visualize and controll where a product is located in the production line in real time, providing precious information such as bottlenecks machines on the production line, problems related to batches of parts, among other issues.

## Credits

The team responsible for development is made up of the students:
[Eric Coutinho](https://github.com/Eric-Coutinho)
[Lander Furusho Gerotto](https://github.com/landergerotto)

And being supervised by Senai instructors, such as:
